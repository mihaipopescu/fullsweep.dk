I am excited to announce that we have started the *FullSweep* project aimed at
raising awareness about the number one environmental issue of our oceans,
**plastic pollution**, by actually _doing something about it_.  It may sound
like a cliché, but we truly believe that _anyone can make a difference_ if one
really wants to.

Ironically, this whole thing is happening thanks to _COVID 19_ lock down which
set in more than one year ago and it forced me to change my routine from biking
to work to [plogging][1].  I may have been inspired by [Spaceship You][2] video
that really made me realize how badly I needed a new routine.  So I started
running in the morning.  And while I was running, I noticed that one piece of
trash was being carried by the wind and was at risk of landing in the water.
So I picked it up and put it in the first trash bin.  Then I found a shopping
bag and I used it to collect more trash along the way.  This is how it all
started.

Some months in, not only that I was not in danger of becoming a couch potato
but also I found a new routine that was more motivational to me than any other
personal development goal of losing weight or alike.  It turns out that having a
higher purpose goal works out better for me than anything else.

I'm living in [Sluseholmen][3], a beautiful Venice-inspired residential
neighborhood in Copenhagen.  There are canals around each building and there's
always some piece of trash laying on the streets.  And my thinking is this.
If any of them ends up in the water, it will be picked up by the currents and
will end up in the ocean.  Since I'm running anyway, I might as well pick it up
myself and prevent that ever from happening.

And what other better goal than trying to keep our oceans clean? Our oceans are
of monumental importance to our life here on Earth and to the future of our
species.  It might seem like a very big problem to tackle by yourself but you
don't need to fix all the problems at once and you're definitely not alone.  You
can _start small but dream big_ and find others like-minded people to support
you along the way.  It's more important to _know what you want to do_.  You'll
figure out the how later.

If we choose to spend a little bit of our energy to _the cause_, we will
obviously have only a minor insignificant difference in the beginning, but small
changes contribute incrementally to bigger ones and can have ripples beyond our
comprehension, similar to the [Butterfly Effect][4].

Even for me, the energy that I'm spending writing this article, has an unknown
_"return of investment"_.  How would I know how many people is it going to read
it?  And how many people, out of those, will be inspired and start doing
something about it?  But if I'm able to inspire only 10 people and those can
inspire 10 more, then I've reached 100 people.  And since we've become
ever-increasingly connected thanks to the internet almost everybody is not more
than [six degrees of separation][5] from anyone else, the impact of our actions
can be tremendous.

At any given moment in time, you have to be able to distinguish the things you
**can do** from the things you **can not do** and just start _acting_ on the
things you can make a difference.  It's as simple as that.  There's no magic.

In stoic philosophy, this concept is referred as the _Dichotomy of Control_ and
it's the ability to understand what *is* and what is *not* within our control.
It's considered one of the most important tenets of the stoic philosophy and one
that I use every day.

> There are things which are within our power, and there are things
> which are beyond our power. Within our power are opinion, aim, desire,
> aversion, and, in one word, whatever affairs are our own. Beyond our
> power are body, property, reputation, office, and, in one word,
> whatever are not properly our own affairs. — Epictetus, Enchiridion.

Here's a great article, on [The Stoic Dichotomy of Control][6] if you are
interested to learn more about the subject.

One year ago, I started plogging and found amazing like-minded people all around
me that support me which I will be writing up next.  I did a lot of full sweeps
along the canals and will continue to do so whenever I can.

What do you think about this?  Are you coming?
